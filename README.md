Certainly! Here's a basic outline for your Text-based Adventure Game project:

Project Outline: Text-based Adventure Game
Objective: Develop a text-based adventure game using Java.

Project Structure:

Introduction:

Welcome message and brief overview of the game.
Display initial scenario and set the stage for the adventure.
User Input Handling:

Implement a mechanism to capture user input for decision-making.
Include error handling for invalid inputs to provide a smooth user experience.
Game Logic:

Design a clear storyline with multiple decision points.
Create branching paths based on user choices, leading to different outcomes.
Include a variety of scenarios and challenges to make the game engaging.
User Interface:

Develop a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and prompts.
Display relevant information, choices, and outcomes in a structured manner.
Documentation:

Comment your code to explain complex logic and decision points.
Include a README file with an overview of the game, instructions for playing, and any additional notes.
Testing:

Thoroughly test your game to ensure all decision paths work correctly.
Address any bugs or issues that arise during testing.
Best Practices:

Organize your code following best practices for readability and maintainability.
Ensure the code is well-documented, making it easy for others to understand

                    System.exit(0);
                default:
                    System.out.println("Invalid choice. Please enter 1, 2, or 3.");
            }
        }
    }
